* What is the command to list the contents of a direcory, line by line and ordered by size ascending in human readable format?
    $ ls -lrthaSR

* How would you add a DNS server to a network interface in Linux?
    There are 2 ways:
        The first way(Permanently adding DNS)
            * vim /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
                - Add the following(This is for multiple DNS entries):
                    + DNS0={{IP Address}} or {{hostname}}
                    + DNS1={{IP Address}} or {{hostname}}
                    + DNS2={{IP Address}} or {{hostname}}

            * Restart the network:
                - Issue the following command(User should have the relevant permissions)
                    $ sudo systemctl restart network.service

        The second way(This is temporary). This will clear after reboot.
            * vim /etc/resolv.conf
                - Add the following:
                    + nameserver {{IP Address}} or {{hostname}}

* If the DNS server you've just added is not reachable, how can you get any particular hostname to resolve locally?
    Edit the below:
        $ sudo vim /etc/hosts
            + {{IP address}} DNS/hostname

            i.e 212.27.32.177 server1.example.ndomi

* How would you check for SELinux related errors?
    - You can see any SELinux related issues in "/var/log/audit/audit.log"
        * This is without any additional tools.
        * This is a little time consuming

    - Install the following tool/s(User should have the relevant permissions):
        * setroubleshoot setools
            $ sudo yum install setroubleshoot setools -y

        * Issue the following command:
            $ sudo sealert -a /var/log/audit/audit.log

* Write the commands to add 30GB disk space to a logical volume named "docker" that belongs to a logical group named "docker-group".
    $ pvcreate /dev/vdb1
    $ vgcreate docker-group /dev/vdb1
    $ lvcreate -L 30G -n docker docker-group
    $ mkfs.ext4 /dev/docker-group/docker
    $ vim /etc/fstab
        /dev/docker-group/docker        /mnt    ext4    defaults        0 0
    mount -a


    - If the question meant that I should extend by 30G:
        $ lvextend -L +30G /dev/docker-group/docker
